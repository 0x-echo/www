We don't judge on comments.
But we use algorithm to detect spam comments and will no save them to Arweave.

But if a wallet continuously post spam comments, our server node may refuse to save its data.

#Anyone can comment?
Currently only wallets with balance more than 0 can comment.

#Is there any service fee when tipping?
Tipping is completely free. But as you know, sending transaction will consume some gas fee.

For login, you can use any chain that MetaMask supported and Phantom(Solana).
For tipping, you can use eth/polygon. And more chains will be supported soon.

Screen name is synchronized from your address' reverse records.
Currently we support the following DID: .bit and ens.
You can set your wallet's reverse record on .bit or ens, and then update profile by clicking the dropdown menu: Refresh my profile.

#How to set my avatar?
Like screen name, it's synchronized from your did's records.
If you are using ens, it will cost gas fee to set or update avatar.
